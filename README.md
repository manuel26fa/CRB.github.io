# CRB.github.io
A mock website for an interior design company. Basically just to try out a few things, as I'm quite new to HTML & CSS.
(PS don't click on the ABOUT US or CONTACT subpages. I definitely haven't let them undone... trust me)

Mock website, made as per the reasons above.

The site may or may not be open for viewing at any one particular point in time based off whether I have some homework to present or not, as our teacher asks us to present... 
...it via a github link.
If for some ungodly reason you have decided to look through those, then you may have noticed the not-so-subtle lack of effort I've put into those compared to this one.

It's not exactly a mega-project; in fact, so far I've probably not dedicated any more than 5-6 hours, but it's more so more so a way for me to test what I've learned, both in...
...class and at home, and for what it's worth(at the very least at the time of writing), I'm quite proud!

Keep in mind I've only been learning HTML & CSS for a little over a month, so don't be too harsh on this obviously novice piece of work :(

I have also, since the creation of this repository, discovered the pain that is the variation in aspect ratios from device to device. I have currently got quite literally...
...zero idea on how to sort that out. As a matter of fact, I have yet to discover the way of how to apply a fixed screen resolution to this piece of hot garbage, so until I can find...
...some time to sit down and learn how to do that, I have mostly been reliant on flex-boxes and <br> tags to generate empty space to create adequate spacing for the device I'm working on.

Speaking of 'finding some time to sit down and learn', this is probably a stupid waste of time that could have been put to better use in order to learn the witchcraft that is...
...transferrable and adequate aspect ratios/ screen resolutions- so I'm going to shut up now, go for a cigarette, and most likely completely forget about the...
...fact that I was supposed to research how to perform that enigmatic witchcraft. I shall hence dub this inevitable catastrophic brain failure 'procrastinative memory'.

I will be very impressed if this message doesn't get overlooked and forgotten about for the remainder of the internet's lifespan, which I imagine is at least 20 minutes from now, so...
...I'm cheering on for you beautiful weirdos who for some truly strange reason take it upon yourselves to scour and scavenge for the most random and irrelevant pieces of media on...
...the internet.
